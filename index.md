## About Me
I am a scientist at Silicon Austria Labs focusing on machine learning and formal methods.

Following are my main research interest topics:
- Design and development of automata learning algorithms
- Development of <ins>[**AALpy**](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/)</ins>, an automata learning library
- Practical applications of automata learning
- Practical applications of machine learning
- Analysis of RNNs with automata learning
- Modeling of continuous stochastic environments (reinforcement learning)
