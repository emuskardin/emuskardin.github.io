### About Me
I am a computer science Ph.D. student at the DES Lab. DES Lab is a collaboration between Silicon Austria Labs and Graz University of Technology.

My research focus can be summarized as **FM meets AI**.  In short, we are using formal methods to verify the correctness of software systems, more concretely, AI-based software components.
Our "formal method of choice" is active automata learning. We focus on its applications, and tackling its inherent challenges.
